Notes:
1. Currently the buildebpackage.sh tool is only used to build thinkstack debian package
based on the mirrantis debian package
2. For new added component in thinkstack, cannot support
3. only support ubuntu, no gurrante for other os

How to use it?
1. copy the mirrantis mos-update main repository into same directory where tool locate
please keep one version for each component.
2. git clone the thinkstack code into ThinkStackU into same directory where tool lcoate
3. ./builddebpackage.sh [version] [component(s) | all ]

main --> mirrantis debian packages directory, required
