Notes:
1. Currently the buildebpackage.sh tool is only used to build thinkstack debian package
based on the mirrantis debian package
2. For new added component in thinkstack, cannot support
3. only support ubuntu, no gurrante for other os

How to use it?
1. git clone the thinkstack code into ThinkStackU into same directory where tool lcoate
2. ./builddebpackage.sh [version] [component(s) | all ]

directory arch?
build-->thinkstack debian package directory,optional, if not exists, tool will create it
ThinkStackU--> thinkstack source code, required
stage --> for build usage, if not exists, optional, tool will create it
builddebpackage.sh --> build tool
scripts ---> build script for each component
